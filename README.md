# \<sxy-autocreate>

## What is this?

This is a simple menu type plugin that converts attributes `esld:x` and `esld:y` from the namespace `https://transpower.co.nz/SCL/SSD/SLD/v0` (absolute coordinates) to attributes `sxy:x` and `sxy:y` from namespace `http://www.iec.ch/61850/2003/SCLcoordinates` (relative coordinates).

This is a rapid prototype and tested only manually. PLEASE use with care.

## Local Demo with `web-dev-server`

```bash
npm start
```
